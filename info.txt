Creating a NPM module for Ticketing application that will have the core functionalities of 
error handling and middleware which can be re-used in the Ticketing Application.

The existing code is written in typescript and hence a conversion from ts to js is done using the 
typescript compiler "tsc". For that a build script written in package.json and also creating and. 
A build folder is created in the src directory with the converted javascript code.
(config for this is done in the tsconfig.json)

There are two scripts written inside the package.json 
    > clean : "del ./build/*"           This cleans up the build directory before we build the module again
    > build : "npm run clean && tsc"    Runs the clean script and also the typescript compiler to generate
                                        javascript code in build directory
